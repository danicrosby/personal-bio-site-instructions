# Personal Bio Site 3: Making your Personal Bio Site Data-Driven

## Prerequisite

> :warning: This exercise requires you to have completed the [Part 2: Making your Personal Bio Site a Single Page Application](./personal-bio-site-02.md) exercise

## Requirements

- Use an axios.get to get that data from firebase.  Then use this data to populate the projects section of your site. (this just means make an axios call in your get function instead of returning the projects array)
- this project has NO authentication - you don't need to do any of that authentication stuff

### Deploy your personal site
- Deploy your personal site to firebase or Netlify
- Add the link to your personal site to your card in CodeTracker (your site doesn't need to be done to send the link - we are just keeping track of the links for now.)
